Installation
============

  DynaGuard relies on Pin (http://www.pintool.org), which is a dynamic binary
instrumentation (DBI) framework from Intel. In order to install DynaGuard you
first need a working copy on the latest Pin build, as well as the essential
build tools for GNU/Linux (i.e., GCC, GNU Make, etc.).

  The simplest way to compile this package is the following:

  1. Extract the latest Pin build. Assuming that it was extracted in
     `/usr/src/pin', we shall refer to that path as Pin's root path
      from now on.

  2. Type `export PIN_HOME=/usr/src/pin' to set the environment
     variable PIN_HOME to the root path of Pin. Replace `/usr/src/pin'
     with *your* root path.

  3. `cd' to the directory dynaguard_pin/, which contains the source code for
     the DBI version of DynaGuard and type `make' to compile.
     NOTE: you may also need libbsd-dev; in Debian GNU/Linux (or in any other
           Debian-based distribution) type `sudo apt-get install libbsd-dev'
           to install it.


Usage
=====

  After building the DynaGuard pintool you can apply it directly in unmodified
x86/x86-64 Linux binaries as follows (assuming that Pin in installed in
`/usr/src/pin', and the DynaGuard pintool lies in your local home directory):

    /usr/src/pin/pin.sh -follow_execv -t ~/dynaguard.so -- <executable>

Compilers and Options
=====================

  Tested with gcc/g++ 4.7.x on Debian GNU/Linux v7 (wheezy) and gcc/g++ 4.9.x on
Debian GNU/Linux v8 (jessie).
